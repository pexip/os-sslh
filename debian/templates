Type: select
__Choices: from inetd, standalone
Default: standalone
_Description: Run sslh:
 sslh can be run either as a service from inetd, or as a standalone
 server. Each choice has its own benefits. With only a few connection
 per day, it is probably better to run sslh from inetd in
 order to save resources.
 .
 On the other hand, with many connections,
 sslh should run as a standalone server to avoid spawning a new
 process for each incoming connection.
